# Youtube watch bot

NodeJS program for view botting, watch time botting, comment botting, and like botting
You can use it as a CLI, as a simple program or by using its API, with control over every part of the program

If you want to create your own view bot, use my API: https://github.com/JijaProGamer/youtube-selfbot-api
